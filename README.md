##Analyse and compare TCP Hybla, TCP Westwood+, and TCP YeAH-TCP performance. Select a Dumbbell
topology with two routers R1 and R2 connected by a (10 Mbps, 50 ms) wired link. Each of the routers is
connected to 3 hosts, i.e. H1, H2, H3 (i.e. senders) are connected to R1, and H4, H5, H6 (i.e. receivers) are
connected to R2. The hosts are attached with (100 Mbps, 20 ms) links. Both the routers use drop-tail queues
with queue size set according to bandwidth-delay product. Senders (i.e. H1, H2 and H3) are attached with TCP
Hybla, TCP Westwood+, and TCP YeAH-TCP agents, respectively. Choose a packet size of 1.3 KB and perform
the following tasks. Make appropriate assumptions wherever necessary.
1. Start only one flow and analyse the throughput over sufficiently long duration. Mention how you select
the duration. Plot the evolution of congestion window w.r.t. time. Perform this experiment with all the
flows attached to all the three sending agents.
2. In the next experiment, start 2 other flows sharing the bottleneck while the first one is in progress and
measure the throughput (in Kbps) of each flow. Plot the throughput and evolution of the TCP
congestion window for each of the flow at a steady-state. Report the maximum throughput observed for
each of the flows.
3. Measure the congestion loss and the goodput over the duration of the experiment for each of the flows.
